# Dynamo Development - London Hackathon 2019

There are multiple ways to improve Dynamo creating your custom functionality, with varying levels of difficulty. Learn the basic of custom development and more advance improvement using c#.

## Learning objectives

* Learn about the different types of custom Dynamo nodes.
* Lear how to set up the Visual Studio environment for development and debugging with Dynamo
* Learn how to develop, test and deploy a Zero Touch node
* Learn how to implement a custom UI
* Learn how to develop, test and deploy explicit custom Dynamo nodes
* Lear how to publish your nodes using the package manager

## Table of Contents

### [Development in Dynamo](./00-DevelopmentInDynamo/00-Introduction.md)
Get a high-level understanding of the different approaches to follow in order to customize and create new features on Dynamo.

### [Custom Nested Nodes](./01-CustomNodes/00-Introduction.md)
Section to briefly introduce and/or refresh what **Custom Nested Nodes** are and their benefits/disadvantages.

### [Python Script](./02-PythonScript/00-Introduction.md)
Python is one of the best first options to use *text-base* programming within the Dynamo environment.

### [ZeroTouch Nodes](./03-ZeroTouch/00-Introduction.md)
