# 4.5 - Conclusion

We have seen the principles behind explicit custom nodes, and this workshop has given you the basis to get started with development. 

There are some technical challenges but also great benefits if you decide to build and use this type of custom node. WPF is a very powerful and widely useful framework, you'll be able to find lots of resources online and existing UI components to reuse. 

We have also seen how to publish your nodes online and contribute to the Dynamo community, if is a very straightforward process once you have set up your project correctly.

Happy coding!
