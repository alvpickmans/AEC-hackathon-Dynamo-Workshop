# Python in Dynamo

This section will go through the basics on how to write custom python code within Dynamo.

Dynamo has a powerful feature, similar to other VPL, which is the ability to write custom python code on its own text editor, allowing to perform large methods and logic in a compressed and more performant manner, by being able to load libraries an modules like ProtoGeometry and Revit utilities.
