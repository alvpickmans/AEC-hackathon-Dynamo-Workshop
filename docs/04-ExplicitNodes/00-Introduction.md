# Custom UI Nodes Development for Dynamo

![Explicit Nodes Icon](assets/00-CustomUI-icon.png)

This material will go through on how to start creating your own Dynamo Explicit/Custom UI nodes using Visual Studio 2017.

This approach is more advanced and complicated than the Zero Touch one, but nodes built this way have the most flexibility and power.

You will learn how to implement a custom UI, respond to other nodes and affect the state of the graph. You will also learn how to package your nodes and distribute them using the Dynamo Package Manager.
